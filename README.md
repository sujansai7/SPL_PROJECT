## Room Reservation System for Library 

Project Idea:
The project idea is to build a system which will help students book rooms in the library by checking for
their availability on a specific date or period. The project comprises two parts, namely,
  1. Front-end: The front end will consist of a web page which will be displayed to the users for several
     tasks like login, sign in, check room availability, book an available room, contact the website, or know
     about the website. Once the user enters all their personal details on the login page, they can sign in to
     their account whenever they want to book the library room.
  2. Back end: The back-end section of the project will consist of the database where all the data/
     personal information of the users and library rooms will be saved.
     
Use Cases:
1. Login Page/Signup Page: If the user is a first-time user, a new account needs to be created by taking
details like name, phone number, email id, student id, username and password.
2. Sign-in: The user must log in using their username and password as credentials. The user has already
filled in all his details; he may sign in to his account with the credentials whenever he wants to check
the room's availability for booking.
3. Availability Check: The user can check for the availability of the study rooms in the library for specific
dates even without booking the room.
4. Booking Page: A user can select a specific study room's available date and time. After reserving the
room by clicking the 'Yes' button, the booking is confirmed.
5. Booking Confirmation: Once the room is booked, no other user can book the same room to avoid
confusion amongst the people.
6. Contact us: The user can contact the website authorities or staff in case of queries using email or call
options using the Contact us tab.
7. About us: Users can check out the information about the website using the About us functionality tab.
